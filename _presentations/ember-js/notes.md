Ember Talk

- Intro
-	Fundamentals
-	Code demo app
- URLs
-	how we share content on the web
	- share an article, a file.. you see the same thing
-	not something you opt-in
-	first class citizen in Ember
-	think real hard about whether you should not have a URL
- Client side framework requires different thinking
-	short lived app vs long lived app
-	different data reflects app lifecycle
-	models: data persists across all sessions
-	controllers: data for that one session
-	views/templates: what is currently on screen
-	divides: what's easy to regenerate and what's not
- Why does it matter how long these live?
-	Garbage collection
- Ember decides when and how to render content
-	careful, DOM elements might not exist
-	cannot use jQuery whenever wherever
-	has its own run loop
- Ember is HTML
- resources, routes, models, controllers, transitions/redirects, views, templates, partials, layouts, helpers, data binding
