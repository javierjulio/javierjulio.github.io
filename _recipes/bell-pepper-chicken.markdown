This is a great dish if you are short on time and want something filling with little effort. No need to do much beforehand and only takes a few minutes to get everything ready before cooking.

### Ingredients

- Package of skinless, boneless chicken breast
- 1/2 red pepper per chicken
- 1 garlic clove per chicken
- Butter
- Pepper
- Salt
- White wine

### Directions

- Buy a package of skinless, boneless chicken breast
- For each piece of chicken wash and cut 1/2 a red pepper and chop 1 large garlic clove
- On a plate place chicken, add pepper, salt and garlic to all sides
- Heat pan at high and add 1 tablespoon of butter
- Once butter is melted add chicken and then the red peppers
- Heat at medium for 4 minutes to each side
- After each side is cooked turn heat on low
- Add some white wine (as much as you like) that will make a nice sauce to go with the chicken
- Scrap the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula to make a brown sauce
- Once done turn off the heat and serve
