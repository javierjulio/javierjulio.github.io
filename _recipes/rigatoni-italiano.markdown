We've also called this "Greek Pasta" at home. It has great flavor while being easy and fast to make. You can prepare all the ingredients while the pasta is boiling.

### Ingredients

- Rigatoni pasta
- Fresh or dry basil
- Feta cheese
- Cherry tomatoes
- Olive oil

### Directions

- Wash and then chop several large leaves of basil
- Dry basil works just fine if you don't have any fresh leaves
- Chop feta cheese into small squares (or they can be purchased crumbled)
- Chop 2 or 3 fresh tomatoes (cherry tomatoes work great too!)
- Boil the rigatoni pasta
- Remove the boiling water and put the pasta back in the pot
- Add in the basil, tomatoes and feta cheese
- Add as much olive oil as you like
- Mix the pasta and sauce well before serving
