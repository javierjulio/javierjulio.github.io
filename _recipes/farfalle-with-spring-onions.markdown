This is to simple for some but tastes great and makes an excellent side for any other dish. Goes really well with my recipe for milanesas.

### Ingredients

- Farfalle pasta
- 4 or 5 spring onions
- Olive oil
- Butter

### Directions

- Cut 4-5 spring onions in half and wash them well
- Once spring onions are clean, chop them up
- Boil the farfalle pasta
- With a minute left save a big spoonful or two of the boiling water
- Remove the boiling water and put the pasta back in the pot
- Add 2 tablespoons of butter
- Toss in the spring onions
- Add a fair amount of olive oil
- Add the boiling water you saved (helps by not needing to use so much olive oil)
- While in the pot mix the pasta well and then serve
