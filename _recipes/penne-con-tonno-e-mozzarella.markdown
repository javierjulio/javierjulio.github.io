What I love most about this dish is that it has a chewy, rewarding texture and is really full of flavor. You'll love the melted mozzarella with the tuna.

### Ingredients

- Penne or Mezze Penne pasta
- 2-5 large garlic cloves
- 1/2 pound mozzarella
- Fresh or dry basil
- 5 anchovy fillets
- Capers
- Roasted pimientos
- 2 cans of tuna
- Olive oil
- Crushed red pepper
- Pepper
- Salt

### Directions

- Chop finely 10-15 large, fresh basil leaves
- Chop 2-5 garlic cloves (or more if you like)
- Open 2 cans of tuna with the lid still attached (keeps the tuna from falling out) and pour out all the oil/water
- Break the tuna into small pieces using a wooden spoon or knife
- Drain 3 tablespoons of capers
- Chop about 1 pound or less of Mozzarella cheese into small cubes
- For extra color chop very finely 1 or 2 chopped roasted pimientos (optional, highly recommended)
- Throw all ingredients into a large bowl
- Add olive oil, salt, black pepper, and some crushed red pepper flakes (if you want it to have a little kick)
- Boil the penne or mezze penne pasta (boiling time written on package)
- Stir pasta frequently while boiling (every 3 minutes or so) to prevent sticking
- Remove the boiling water and drop the pasta in the sauce pan
- Mix well and serve
