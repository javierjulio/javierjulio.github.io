If you love a traditional Margherita pizza you will enjoy this. It's got so much in common because the chunks of mozzarella melt with the cooked pasta.

### Ingredients

- Fusilli pasta
- 6 vine tomatoes
- 2 large garlic cloves
- Fresh or dry basil
- Anchovy fillets or capers
- 1/2 pound of mozzarella
- Olive oil
- Oregano
- Pepper
- Salt
- Roasted pimientos

### Directions

- Chop 6 vine tomatoes and 2 large garlic cloves
- Wash and then chop 20 leaves of fresh basil (dry basil works fine)
- Chop 5 anchovy fillets *or* drain 1 tablespoon of capers
- Dice 1/2 pound of mozzarella into small cubes
- Toss all the ingredients listed above into a big bowl
- Add a little oregano, salt and pepper to taste, mix well
- Leave the sauce to marinate for 1 to 3 hours at room temperature
- Boil the Fusilli pasta (boiling time written on package)
- Stir pasta frequently while boiling (every 3 minutes or so) to prevent sticking
- Remove the boiling water and drop the pasta in the sauce bowl
- Mix well and serve
