The secret for this recipe is using Japanese breadcrumbs called [Panko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panko). Packaged breadcrumbs or making your own just doesn't come close. Trust me. I've tried it all. I highly recommend preparing these in advance and letting them marinate for several hours or better yet overnight.

### Ingredients

- Thin cuts of bottom round steak
- Japanese breadcrumbs (Panko)
- 4-6 large garlic cloves
- 3-4 eggs
- Olive oil
- Lemons (many!)
- Parsley
- Crushed red pepper
- Pepper
- Salt

### Directions

- Place 1 plate and 2 bowls on the counter
- In the first bowl crack open eggs
- Add crushed red pepper (optional), pepper, salt, parsley, and garlic (the more the better)
- Take a fork and mix well
- Have the steak sit in the egg mix for at least 15-30 minutes to marinate (or better yet overnight)
- In the second bowl add breadcrumbs
- Assign only one hand to remove steak from the egg
- Take each piece of steak and smash each side into the bowl of breadcrumbs to not only stick well but to flatten the steak
- Pour a thin layer of olive oil in a cooking pan
- Cook milanesa at about medium heat for about 1-2 minutes each side (or until breadcrumbs are a golden brown color)
- You can place each piece and wrap in paper towel to soak up any grease
- Cut lemons in half and squeeze lemon juice on milanesas or serve separately
