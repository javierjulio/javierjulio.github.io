This is my mother's paella recipe. Not too different from the traditional dish, just made with a lot of sofrito. Make sure to serve with plenty of lemons!

### Ingredients

- 1 large vidalia or yellow onion
- 1 large red pepper
- 1 large green pepper
- 1 large tomato
- 4-5 garlic cloves
- 1 pound of de-cased chorizos or hot Italian sausage
- Fresh Italian parsley
- 1 pound jumbo shrimp
- Saffron
- Rice
- Olive Oil
- Salt
- Paprika
- 2-3 Lemons

### Directions

- Dice the onion, red and green peppers, tomato and garlic
- Slice or split the chorizo up into small pieces
- Wash and chop the parsley (about 3 tablespoons or so)
- Peel and devein the shrimp
- In a pot boil 3 cups of water
- Add 1.5 cup of rice to pot
- Once boiling set heat to low and add salt
- Simmer the rice for 30 minutes
- Now use a wide pan for the sofrito as you'll add the rice afterwards
- Saut&eacute; the chopped onions and peppers in olive oil for 3 minutes
- Add the garlic for another 2 minutes
- Add the tomato and turn off heat
- Add salt to taste and a lot of paprika (about 3 teaspoons or so)

- Add the rice and water from the pot
- Sprinkle saffron on top of the rice
- Mix well and then heat at low for 20 minutes
- With 2-3 minutes to go turn off heat and place the shrimp on the rice (the steam alone will cook the shrimp)
- Cover and turn heat on low for a few minutes until shrimp turns white/pink losing the raw gray color
- Turn off heat and leave covered for at least 10 minutes
- Before serving sprinkle parsley and mix
- Serve with lemons as it's best with a lot of lemon juice
