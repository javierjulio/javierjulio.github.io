I love onions and shallots (french onions) and use them often in various dishes. This makes for a easy and quick dish that tastes great.

### Ingredients

- Sirloin steak (although any steak will do)
- Olive oil
- Butter (optional, use olive oil instead)
- 2-5 garlic cloves
- Oregano
- Pepper
- Salt

### Directions

- Peel and chop all shallots (minimum 1 shallot per steak)
- In an iron black pan at medium heat drop 1/2 tablespoon of butter
- The butter should turn brown and melt very quickly so add the steak to the pan
- Cook the steak on medium-high heat, each side for 2-3 minutes or depending on thickness
- Once the steak is cooked, remove quickly, place it on a plate and cover it so it stays warm
- Add another 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the pan
- Add several tablespoons of red wine vinegar (or red wine)
- Then toss in the chopped shallots and stir them in the pan (should only take a minute to heat up)
- Add the shallots on top of the steak along with any natural sauce from the pan and serve
