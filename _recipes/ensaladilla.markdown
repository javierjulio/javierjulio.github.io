The Spaniards call Ensaladilla any small dish with mayonnaise. The inspiration came from Ensalada Rusa. Goes great on slices of warm bread as an appetizer.

### Ingredients

- Few leaves of lettuce (Red Leaf suggested)
- 2 spring onions
- Roasted pimientos
- 5 anchovies
- 1 lemon
- 1 can of tuna
- Pepper
- Mayonnaise
- Bread

### Directions

- Chop 2 (or more as you like) spring onions
- Chop roasted pimientos as rectangular strips
- Dice 5 anchovies into small pieces (optional)
- Wash a few leaves of lettuce
- Squeeze all the juice out of a lemon into a cup
- Open 1 can of tuna with the lid still attached (keeps the tuna from falling out) and pour out all the water
- In a bowl add some mayonnaise, add the tuna, lemon juice, spring onions, and anchovies and mix well
- On a plate, place the few pieces of lettuce
- On the same plate add the dip mix
- Place the strips of roasted pimientos on top
- Now you can serve like that in a plate/bowl
- Or take slices of warm baguette bread and place a piece of lettuce with the mix on top
