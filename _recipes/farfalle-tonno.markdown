- 4 or 5 spring onions
- 1 lemon
- Fresh or dry basil
- Black olives
- Roasted pimientos
- 2 cans of tuna
- Olive oil
- Pepper
- Salt

### Directions

- Chop 4 or 5 spring onions
- Peel 1 lemon and slice finely the lemon zest
- Squeeze all the lemon juice out into a cup and remove the seeds
- Chop finely 10-15 large basil leaves
- Chop 20 black olives
- Open 2 cans of tuna with the lid still attached (keeps the tuna from falling out) and pour out all the water
- Break the tuna into small pieces using a wooden spoon or knife
- For extra color chop very finely 1 or 2 chopped roasted pimientos (optional, highly recommended)
- In a cooking pan pour about 1/4 a cup of olive oil and warm it lightly
- Saut&eacute; the spring onions in the olive oil for about 2 minutes
- Once finished do not turn the heat back on
- Add in the lemon zest, basil, olives, tuna, lemon juice, salt and pepper
- Mix the sauce well
- Heat the sauce only to warm lightly just before you add in the pasta
- Boil the Farfalle pasta and save a little bit of the boiling water in a cup
- Toss the pasta in with the sauce
- Add in the small amount of boiling water (helps by not having to add so much olive oil)
- Mix the pasta well before serving
