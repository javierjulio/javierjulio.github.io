Once you have hamburger meat mixed with herbs like basil, garlic and spring onions, its hard to go back. Prepare the hamburgers in advance if you can but if not they taste great cooked as soon as you make it. These make excellent leftovers as they taste even better the next day.

### Ingredients

- Ground beef
- Crushed red pepper flakes
- Olive oil (if not grilling)
- Fresh or dry parsley
- Fresh or dry basil
- Spring Onions
- Garlic
- Pepper
- Salt

### Directions

- Buy a 3 pound pack of 90% ground meat (should make about 8-10 large hamburgers)
- Wash and chop several large leaves of basil (or use dry basil)
- Wash and chop 2-3 spring onions
- Wash and chop a lot of Italian parsley (or use dry parsley)
- Peel and chop about 2-3 large garlic cloves
- Toss the ground meat in a big bowl and add black pepper, salt and crushed red pepper flakes
- Toss in all the 4 ingredients mentioned in steps 2-5 in the bowl
- Mix the ground meat well with your hands
- Roll pieces of ground meat into a ball shape and then smash it
- Place each hamburger on a plate and cook when you are ready
- If you choose not to cook it right away, cover the plate in a plastic wrap or bag and put it in the refrigerator. If you won't cook it in the first day or two of it being in the refrigerator, the hamburgers **will have to go in the freezer**!
