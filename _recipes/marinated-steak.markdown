This is a family favorite for holidays. We buy about a 1 inch thick steak and slice it in thin, wide pieces.

### Ingredients

- Sirloin steak (although any steak will do)
- 2-5 garlic cloves
- 1 Lemon
- Olive oil
- Butter
- Oregano
- Pepper
- Salt

### Directions

- Place the steak in a oval pan (only used for marinating, not cooking)
- Squeeze all the juice out of 1 lemon into a cup
- Chop 2-3 garlic cloves (the more the better)
- Add oregano, olive oil, black pepper and the chopped garlic in the cup
- Stir the marinate sauce well
- Pour the marinate sauce on one side of the steak, flip it, and pour again
- Put the steak in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours but no more than 24
- Before you plan to cook leave the steak out for an hour
- Once ready add a little salt to the steak
- Place a small piece of butter on the grill pan
- Cook each side of the steak for about 6 minutes at medium-high, maybe longer depending on the thickness of the meat
