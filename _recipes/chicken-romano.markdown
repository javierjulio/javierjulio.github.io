If you love fried food but can't stand the grease and fat you will like this. It has all the flavor you would want without any of the unhealthy ingredients. I recommend adding a bit more cheese than breadcrumbs.

### Ingredients

- Package of skinless, boneless chicken breast
- 1 egg for each 3 pieces of chicken
- Japanese breadcrumbs (Panko)
- Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese
- Olive oil
- Thyme
- Pepper
- Salt
- Lemons

### Directions

- Place an empty bowl in the freezer, we'll need this for the egg white later on
- 1 chicken breast per person and 1 egg for each 3 pieces of chicken breast
- Rinse chicken with water and dry with a piece of paper towel
- Take a bowl and add Japanese breadcrumbs, pecorino romano cheese (or parmesan cheese), thyme, salt and pepper and mix well
- Remove empty bowl from the freezer and add an egg white (no yolk)
- Stir the egg white well with a fork till foamy/frosty white (like beer foam)
- Take a piece of chicken and rub both sides in the egg white
- Then again rub both sides well in the bowl of breadcrumbs
- Repeat steps 8-9 for each piece of chicken breast
- Preheat oven at 400 degrees
- Pour a thin cover of olive oil on a cookie sheet and then place the chicken on it
- Bake the chicken for about 20 minutes
- Serve with sliced lemons
