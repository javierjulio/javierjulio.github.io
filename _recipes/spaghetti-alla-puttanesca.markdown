Spaghetti pasta served with black olives, tomatoes and capers but as an uncooked version of the famous Neapolitan dish.

### Ingredients

- Spaghetti pasta
- 2-5 large garlic cloves
- 3 vine tomatoes or cherry tomatoes
- Fresh or dry basil
- Fresh or dry parsley (optional)
- Capers
- Black olives
- Olive oil
- Crushed red pepper
- Salt

### Directions

- Chop 20 or so black olives
- Chop and seed 3 vine tomatoes (important to strip out the center so the sauce doesn't become watery)
- Chop finely 10 fresh, large basil leaves
- Chop 2-5 garlic cloves (if you like a lot of garlic 6 cloves works well)
- Add some fresh parsley (optional)
- Drain 3 tablespoons of capers
- Throw all ingredients into a large bowl
- Add olive oil, salt, and some crushed red pepper flakes
- Boil the spaghetti pasta (boiling time written on package)
- Stir pasta frequently while boiling (every 3 minutes or so) to prevent sticking
- Remove the boiling water and drop the pasta in the sauce pan
- Mix well and serve
