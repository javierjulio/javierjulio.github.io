<p>Hi there, I'm Javier, <a href="https://twitter.com/javierjulio">@javierjulio on Twitter</a>. I'm a full stack software engineer and founding team member at <a href="https://www.jackpocket.com/">Jackpocket</a>. I'm at my best when working closely with a designer to fine tune every interface detail. I love what I do. Don't be shy, say <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">hello</a>.</p>

<p>I'm proficient in Ruby, a beginner in Objective-C, Swift and Node.js, and have been learning Python. Client side I stick with SASS and JavaScript. I'm comfortable with command line tools as I stay organized thanks to my <a href="https://github.com/javierjulio/laptop">laptop script and dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>As a developer it's important to me to keep any project I work on up to date and well tested. I've learned the value of testing as it helps me be aggressive about change. As I get familiar with a codebase I develop ideas on what code can be improved or removed if not utilized. Having tests backs me up and allows me to make those improvements safely and quickly.</p>

<p>Apart from programming, I'm an avid reader and use <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to read what I come across on <a href="https://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a> (through <a href="https://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a>) or <a href="https://twitter.com/javierjulio">Twitter</a>. And of course I share any <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=javierjulio%20instapaper">interesting reads</a>. I love everything soccer. Sometimes I dance tango and milonga. Thanks to my mother, I love to <a href="/recipes">cook and bake</a> for my family and friends. Occasionally I play paintball. If all else fails you'll find me taking it easy watching Netflix or playing games.</p>
