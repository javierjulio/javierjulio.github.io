<p class="text-lead">👋🏻 Hi there, I'm Javi; a thinker and problem solver based in Brooklyn, NY but originally from Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://www.jackpocket.com/">Jackpocket</a> as a <a href="/resume">full stack developer</a> where I joined the company early on as a founding team member.</p>

<p>You can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/javierjulio">on Twitter @javierjulio</a> where sometimes I like to share about development or design. Often though I'm just happiest <a href="https://github.com/javierjulio">building in the open on GitHub</a> with my own personal projects or contributing to others.</p>

<p>Apart from development, I'm an avid news reader using <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. I'm a soccer ⚽️ fanatic, supporting ❤️ Newcastle United. For 2 years, I took tango and milonga 🇦🇷 lessons. Sometimes I play paintball. To relax, I love to <a href="/recipes">cook and bake</a>. I also love playing video games with an active interest in creating them.</p>

<p>Don't be shy, say <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">hello</a>!</p>
