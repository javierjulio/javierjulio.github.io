- Olive oil
- Butter
- Crushed red pepper

### Directions

- Chop 6 anchovy fillets and 2 large garlic cloves
- Wash and then chop a lot of Italian parsley (fresh basil is a great substitute)
- Open 2 cans of tuna with the lid still attached (keeps the tuna from falling out) and pour out all the oil/water
- Break the tuna into small pieces using a wooden spoon or knife
- Pour a thin layer of olive oil in a pan, add 3 tablespoons of butter and heat on low-medium till butter dissolves
- Add garlic and heat for 3 minutes but **do not brown**!
- Add anchovies and their oil to the pan and heat for 2-3 minutes and let anchovies dissolve completely
- Add tuna and add 3/4 cup of white wine
- Stir well and let wine evaporate for 3 minutes until a thick and smooth sauce is formed
- Add parsley (and pepper to taste)
- Stir sauce and turn off heat
- Boil the spaghetti pasta (boiling time written on package)
- Stir pasta frequently while boiling (every 3 minutes or so) to prevent sticking
- Remove the boiling water and drop the pasta in the sauce pan
- Mix well and serve
