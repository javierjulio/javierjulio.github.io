description: Chicken breast covered with breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, and thyme leaves. This dish is lightly fried, a healthier alternative.

The secret for this recipe is using [Panko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panko) (Japanese breadcrumbs). Packaged breadcrumbs or making your own just doesn't come close. Trust me. I've tried it all. As an easy side dish I suggest my [Farfalle with Spring Onions](/recipes/farfalle-with-spring-onions) recipe.

### Ingredients

- Package of skinless, boneless chicken breast (do not use cutlets)
- Japanese breadcrumbs (Panko)
- Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese
- Olive oil or butter
- Lemons (many!)
- Oregano
- Thyme
- Pepper
- Salt
- Flour
- 2-3 eggs (3 eggs for 2 pounds of chicken)

### Directions

- Cut the chicken in half horizontally
- Place 1 plate and 2 bowls on the counter
- In the plate add flour
- In the first bowl crack open 2 eggs, add pepper, salt, and then take a fork and mix well
- In the second bowl put the Japanese breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, pepper, salt, oregano, thyme and mix well
- Assign only one hand to remove the chicken from the egg
- Take a piece of chicken and rub both sides well in the plate of flour
- Then dunk each side of the chicken in the egg mix
- Now smash each side of the chicken into the bowl of breadcrumbs until completely covered
- Repeat steps 6-9 for each piece of chicken
- Take a large cooking pan and put a thin layer of olive oil
- Heat the olive oil at medium to high for about 2 minutes
- Drop half a tablespoon of butter in the cooking pan and spread it around or just use olive oil which works great
- Once the butter is dissolved place each piece of chicken in the pan
- Cook the milanesas at medium for about 1-2 minutes to each side (or until breadcrumbs are a golden brown color)
- You can place each piece and wrap in paper towel to soak up any grease
- Cut lemons in half and squeeze lemon juice on milanesas or serve separately
