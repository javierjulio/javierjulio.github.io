<p class="text-lead">👋🏻 Hi there, I'm Javi; a thinker and problem solver based in Brooklyn, NY but originally from Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://www.jackpocket.com/">Jackpocket</a> (now acquired by DraftKings) as a <a href="/resume">full stack Staff Engineer</a> where I joined the company early on as a founding team member.</p>

<p>You can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/javierjulio">on Twitter @javierjulio</a> where sometimes I like to share about development or design. Often though I'm just happiest <a href="https://github.com/javierjulio">building in the open on GitHub</a> with my own projects or contributing to others.</p>

<p>Apart from development, I'm an avid reader using <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>. I'm a soccer fanatic, supporting Newcastle United. For 2 years, I took tango and milonga lessons. Sometimes I play paintball. To relax, I love to <a href="/recipes">cook and bake</a>, collecting recipes with <a href="https://mela.recipes">Mela</a>. I also love playing video games with an interest in creating them.</p>

<p>Don't be shy, <%= mail_to author_email, "say hello" %>!</p>
